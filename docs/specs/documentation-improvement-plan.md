# Documentation Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for improving the helm-charts repository documentation to enhance usability, accessibility, and completeness.

## 1. General Documentation Structure Improvements

### 1.1 Create a Comprehensive Getting Started Guide
- [ ] Add a `getting-started.md` file in the docs directory
- [ ] Include step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- [ ] Cover basic concepts of the common library and app-template
- [ ] Add examples of deploying a simple application

### 1.2 Develop a Troubleshooting Guide
- [ ] Create a `troubleshooting.md` file with common issues and solutions
- [ ] Include sections for different components (common library, app-template)
- [ ] Add examples of how to debug chart deployments
- [ ] Include common error messages and their resolutions

### 1.3 Add Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Create an `architecture.md` file explaining how the different parts of the repository interact
- [ ] Include diagrams showing the relationship between common library and app-template
- [ ] Explain the templating system and flow of configurations
- [ ] Document the design decisions behind the architecture

### 1.4 Implement Helm Chart Documentation Standards
- [ ] Create a documentation style guide based on industry best practices
- [ ] Standardize Chart.yaml documentation with all required and recommended fields
- [ ] Establish consistent values.yaml documentation with proper comments for each parameter
- [ ] Implement standardized README templates for all charts with:
  - Overview and purpose
  - Prerequisites
  - Installation instructions
  - Configuration options with examples
  - Upgrading instructions
  - Uninstallation instructions
- [ ] Add templates and examples sections with common usage patterns
- [ ] Document Kubernetes version compatibility requirements
- [ ] Clearly document dependencies between charts and external requirements

## 2. Specific Documentation Content Improvements

### 2.1 Update Main README
- [ ] Update the repository README to reflect your organization's branding
- [ ] Include a feature comparison with other Helm chart repositories
- [ ] Add clearer sections for different user personas (beginners vs advanced users)
- [ ] Improve the "Installation" section with more detailed instructions

### 2.2 Improve Chart Documentation
- [ ] Create a standardized documentation format for all charts
- [ ] Add more detailed explanation of values.yaml schema
- [ ] Include version compatibility information for Kubernetes versions
- [ ] Document each chart's lifecycle and maintenance status
- [ ] Implement consistent comment styles for values.yaml using helm-docs compatible format
- [ ] Ensure Chart.yaml includes comprehensive metadata (maintainers, keywords, home, etc.)
- [ ] Add standardized labels and annotations for all resources
- [ ] Implement consistent comment styles for values.yaml using helm-docs compatible format:
  ```yaml
  # -- Description of the parameter
  # @default -- Optional default value explanation
  parameterName: value
  ```
- [ ] Ensure Chart.yaml includes comprehensive metadata (maintainers, keywords, home, etc.)
- [ ] Add standardized labels and annotations for all resources following Kubernetes best practices

### 2.3 Add Migration Guides
- [ ] Create guides for migrating from other chart repositories
- [ ] Document breaking changes between major versions more thoroughly
- [ ] Include comparison tables between different versions
- [ ] Add examples of migration scripts or processes

## 3. Examples and Tutorials Improvements

### 3.1 Expand Examples Directory
- [ ] Add more real-world examples for popular applications
- [ ] Create multi-chart deployment examples showing how multiple applications can work together
- [ ] Add examples for different Kubernetes environments (on-prem, cloud providers)
- [ ] Include examples with varying complexity levels

### 3.2 Add Interactive Tutorials
- [ ] Create step-by-step tutorials for common deployment scenarios
- [ ] Consider adding asciinema recordings or videos for complex deployments
- [ ] Include a "cookbook" section with recipes for specific use cases
- [ ] Create interactive web-based examples if possible

### 3.3 Enhance Integration Examples
- [ ] Improve examples showing integration with Flux, ArgoCD, and other CD tools
- [ ] Add examples for Kustomize integration with more complex scenarios
- [ ] Include examples for monitoring and logging integration
- [ ] Document integration with popular Kubernetes platforms

## 4. Technical Documentation Improvements

### 4.1 Improve API Reference
- [ ] Create a comprehensive API reference for all templates in the common library
- [ ] Document all helper functions and their parameters
- [ ] Include examples for each API function
- [ ] Add a search feature specific to the API documentation

### 4.2 Chart Development Guide
- [ ] Create a detailed guide for developers who want to contribute new charts
- [ ] Document internal conventions and patterns
- [ ] Include a chart review checklist
- [ ] Add best practices for chart development

### 4.3 Versioning Documentation
- [ ] Enhance versioning documentation to clearly explain semantic versioning approach
- [ ] Add examples of what constitutes breaking vs non-breaking changes
- [ ] Create a changelog template for future releases
- [ ] Document the release process

## 5. Website and Navigation Improvements

### 5.1 Improve Navigation Structure
- [ ] Reorganize the documentation sidebar for better discoverability
- [ ] Add a search feature optimization
- [ ] Create a better landing page that highlights key features
- [ ] Implement breadcrumbs for easier navigation

### 5.2 Add Version Selector
- [ ] Implement version selection for documentation to view docs for specific chart versions
- [ ] Ensure old documentation remains accessible
- [ ] Add alerts for deprecated versions
- [ ] Link to migration guides from older versions

### 5.3 Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure documentation is fully responsive for mobile devices
- [ ] Test and optimize for different screen sizes
- [ ] Improve code block display on mobile devices
- [ ] Optimize images for mobile viewing

## 6. Implementation Recommendations

### 6.1 Documentation Testing
- [ ] Implement documentation testing in CI pipeline
- [ ] Add link checking to ensure all documentation links are valid
- [ ] Add spell checking for documentation files
- [ ] Test documentation renders correctly on different devices

### 6.2 Automated Documentation Generation
- [ ] Enhance automated README generation from templates
- [ ] Consider adding automatic values.yaml documentation generation using helm-docs
- [ ] Add automatic screenshot generation for examples
- [ ] Implement versioned documentation builds
- [ ] Set up automatic validation of documentation formatting and standards

### 6.3 User Feedback Mechanism
- [ ] Add a feedback mechanism to documentation pages
- [ ] Create a user survey to understand documentation needs
- [ ] Track documentation usage to identify most referenced sections
- [ ] Implement a system to collect and address user questions

## 7. Priority Implementation Plan

### Short-term (1-2 months)
1. Create the Getting Started guide
2. Update the main README with current information
3. Implement basic documentation testing
4. Expand the examples directory with more real-world examples

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
1. Develop the comprehensive troubleshooting guide
2. Create detailed API references for all components
3. Improve the navigation structure of the documentation site
4. Add version selector for documentation

### Long-term (6+ months)
1. Create the architecture documentation with diagrams
2. Implement interactive tutorials
3. Develop comprehensive migration guides
4. Add user feedback mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### MkDocs Integration
All improvements will be implemented using the existing MkDocs setup:

- New pages will be added to the appropriate sections in the `docs/` directory
- The `mkdocs.yml` file will be updated to include new pages in the navigation
- Documentation will use Material for MkDocs features like admonitions, tabs, and code annotations
- CI/CD pipelines will be updated to build and deploy the enhanced documentation

### Task Automation
Leverage and extend existing Taskfiles:

- Update `.taskfiles/docs.yaml` to include new documentation tasks
- Add validation tasks for documentation quality
- Implement automated screenshot generation
- Add documentation testing tasks
